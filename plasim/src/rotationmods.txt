Modifications to PlaSim to enable it to handle any orbit:


solar_day -> sidereal_day

radmod.f90 -- added new zenith angle calculation based on sidereal time.



solar_day -> standard_day

seamod.f90 -- passing solar day and ntspd to iceini. See below.
icemod.f90 -- solar day used to define a physical relaxation time unrelated to planet properties
oceanmod.f90 -- solar day used again for physical parameters and as a calendar check, called by iceini
